  <h2> IT Technologies </h2>
  <h3> Robots </h3>
  <b>I am pretty sure that you heard about the word “robots” a lot, but do you know what “robots” actually is? Robots are a type of machine that can work automatically by controllers, computers or even by coded circuits. Moreover, depending on what works needed then robots will have a different appearance. For example, NASA wanted to explore the Mars, so they created a robot that called Curiosity to discover the Mars. As far as I know, Curiosity is a robot that has a shape like a car, and Curiosity’s mission is to discover the Gale volcano. In my opinion, the art of technology is something really special because it keeps changing or upgrading constantly day by day. Nowadays, there are a lot of things that can be completed by robots even the job that required a group of people to complete that. If memory serves, I read an article about robots last 2 weeks and I really impressed that what can be done by a robot at 2020. For instance, in 2018, there was a startup called Starship Technologies created the delivery robots that used six-wheeled and self-driving technology to navigate the location to deliver the packages in a small city from northwest of London. The author said that the first time he saw the delivery robot, he thought that it is cute but pointless. However, due to the lockdown that caused by Coronavirus, this robot become the most useful machine in 2020. Because it helps people who want to order anything from grocery but they cannot go outside and buy it, so they order it online and wait the delivery robot ship it to them. Moreover, I found that Amazon has a delivery robot which named is Scout, Scout also used six-wheeled and self-driving technology as well, but there is a negative side is that it is only delivery to “Prime customers”. To me, in the near future, the development of the robotics will make a huge change to the world; one of the changes that I hope it will able to done soon is the Firefighter robots. My ex-roommate was a firefighter in Chicago, as far as I know that Chicago has a high percentage of conflagration and sometimes it really hard to control it. Unfortunately, my roommate passed away when he tried to rescue a family that stuck inside the building. Therefore, it would be great if firefighter robots will be created soon and it will be used by government only. In my opinion, to make this possible, we need to spend a lot of money, time and materials. To start with, I am going to talk about the technological on this robot. First of all, we need to create an extremely sensitive sensor that can detect human’s heart beat or brainwaves. For example, when people stuck inside the building and they are covering by smoke; they cannot breathe but their heart beat and brainwaves still working. Therefore, the robots can detect that and locate their position to come and rescue them. Secondly, we need to add for the robots the short “voice-message” like “I am a firefighter robot, I am here to save you” to let people know it is the firefighter robots that come and rescue them. Last but not least, we need to make the robots a little big but flexible. Thus, the main reason that the robots need to big because it will have the cabin inside to let people stay inside the cabin, and flexible to move fast to save people. Next, I am going to point out the materials of the robots. In my point of view, the robots need to have a best material in case it will be burnt by the fire when they go inside the fire. In addition, the outside materials of the robots must to be the insulating materials like heat proof, and inside of the robots need to be the material that can turn heat into cool. In my perspective, the potential impact of this development will be about the safety of humanity. According to the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), it said that more than 50 firefighters died in the conflagration each year because firefighter is a dangerous job. Therefore, if the firefighter robots can be created, it will decrease the death percentage of firefighters; moreover, there are no firefighters will die when they try to rescue someone. However, this change will affect the most to the firefighter’s job. I mean that the robots are going to decrease the job, and maybe that the real firefighters will lose their job. In general, if the robotics grow up in the next few years, I think it will create an economy crisis; because robotics will replace the job that human can do, so when people lose their job, they will need to wait for the support from government. To me, everything has both aspects, one is positive, another is negative. For example, robots should be created to do dangerous jobs such as firefighters, explore the volcano, etc. And let human do the traditional job like work on the factory, or sometimes pack all the stuff. Currently, there are a few jobs that were replaced by robots, but I just name a major job that got replaced. The first job that replaced by robots is telemarketers, this is kind of a robot-calls with a variety services. Then, the most popular is the cashier, in 2018, Walmart launched the first cashier robots, the robot’s eyes have a sensor that can scan the bar code and can help customers check out. As an IT student, I think this will affect me a lot. After reading those articles, I feel like that I have a lot of energies to create something new and better for the world. However, I am really concerned about if this is going to develop in the future. For example, if you can create a robot that can do multitask that means it will be extremely hard to fix (complicated program) when it broke or bugged; so, I think this problem will make everything a little bit difficult for me to work on my project. On the other hand, I think that my family members such as my dad and mom will love these technologies in the future. As I remember, my dad told me to create for him a robot that can cook for him and my mom, so, my mom does not to worry about the cooking stuff. To be honest, I think everything always have 2 aspects, but if you create a robot to help your family members that will be fine. However, as I said above, robots should be created to do dangerous job only.
